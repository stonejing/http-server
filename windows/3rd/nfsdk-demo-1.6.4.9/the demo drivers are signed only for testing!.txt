For Windows Vista x64 and later versions of the Windows family of operating systems, kernel-mode software must have a digital signature to load on x64-based computer systems. 
The included demo versions of the network hooking driver are signed. But the drivers in Standard and Full sources versions are not signed.
For the end-user software you have to obtain the Code Signing certificate and sign the driver.

The drivers must be signed by two certificates:

- Code signing certificate from one of the supported authorities:
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/drvsign/crosscert.mspx

- Cross-certificate from Microsoft, which can be downloaded from the same page.

- signtool.exe utility must be used with /ac option specifying the appropriate cross-certificate. The utility is included in Windows SDK and WDK.

The latest version of Windows 10 requires signing with EV certificate using Microsoft Dev Portal:

So to make WFP driver work on a clean installation of Windows 10 build
1607 it is necessary to get a EV code signing certificate, register on
Dev Portal, prepare .cab archive with the driver and some inf file and
sign the driver on the portal.

To prepare the cab files required for signing via Microsoft Dev Portal it is possible to use this set of scripts:

For  previous  versions  of  Windows  it  is  possible  to use the old
approach,  signing  the driver with signtool and cross-certificate. It
is   easier,   because  the binaries signed via Dev Portal work only on
Windows 10, and don't work on Windows 7/8 without HCK test:

The Microsoft Trusted Root Program no longer supports root certificates that have kernel mode signing capabilities:
